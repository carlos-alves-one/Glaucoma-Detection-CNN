# VisionGuard AI: Deep Learning for Early Glaucoma Detection

## Introduction

This project, developed at Goldsmiths University of London for the MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, aims to develop a deep learning model for identifying glaucoma by analyzing ocular pictures. Authored by Carlos Manuel De Oliveira Alves (Student ID: cdeol003), this research outlines the progression of a deep-learning model designed to identify glaucoma through the analysis of ocular pictures.

## Research Purpose

The project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to identify glaucoma in its early stages by analyzing ocular images. Early detection is crucial as glaucoma is a severe ocular disorder that can lead to complete vision loss if undetected.

## Relevance of the Problem

Glaucoma represents a significant health issue due to its potential to cause irreversible vision loss. The asymptomatic nature of early-stage glaucoma emphasizes the importance of developing effective screening procedures. This project seeks to address this need through the application of deep learning.

## Role of Deep Learning

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning algorithms, are employed in this project for their proficiency in image identification tasks. The use of CNNs aims to provide a reliable method for the early detection of glaucoma through ocular image analysis.

## Dataset Description

The research utilizes a dataset comprising ocular pictures labelled with a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of glaucoma. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the performance of the CNN model in identifying signs of glaucoma.

## Key Clinical Parameter - ExpCDR

A critical clinical parameter in this research is the 'Cup to Disc Ratio' (ExpCDR), which plays a significant role in evaluating the presence of glaucoma in the images. The accurate assessment of ExpCDR is critical to the effectiveness of the deep learning model in detecting glaucoma.
